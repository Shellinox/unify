# Unify

Unify is a social networking app designed for college students to post text-based content anonymously, interact with posts through liking, disliking, and commenting, and customize their experience with a dark or light theme.

## Features

- **Anonymous Posts**: College students can share their thoughts, opinions, and experiences without revealing their identity, fostering open and honest communication within the college community.
- **Interactions**: Users can like, dislike, and comment on posts to express their opinions, provide support, or engage in discussions with fellow students.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Customize the app's appearance based on personal preference for better readability and visual comfort, especially during late-night study sessions.
